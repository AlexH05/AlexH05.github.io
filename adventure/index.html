<li> Today we went to universal in California. We first got up early and ate a big coninental breakfast at the hotel. Next we got dressed and ready for the drive down there. We drove our rental car and got there just in time for open. We got there early so we could spend the whole day there and get our money's worth. Then we made a list of things we want to try and get to.</li>

<!--This is my unordered list-->
<ul> 
    <li>Harry Potter interactive wand</li>
    <li>Simpsons giant donut</li>
    <li>Harry Potter Butterbeer</li>

<li>  Once we got into the Park we had to take a picture of the Universal globe. <img src = "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2Funiversal-studios-hollywood-1.jpg&q=85" alt="universal globe" width="400" height="300">.  Our next stop was in the <Strong>Jurassic Park</Strong> section. We first had to get a picture with Blue before we could go on any rides. Then the Jurrasic Park ride came and we got soaked. <img src="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/sites/visitcalifornia.com/files/styles/welcome_image/public/vc_jurassicworldtheride_universalstudioshollywood_supplied_jurassicworldtheride9_1280x640.jpg" alt="Jurrasic Park ride" width="550" height="300"> Then we headed over to <Strong>Diagon Alley</Strong> where there were a bunch of shops and resturants for us to look at. This is where we got an interactive wand and tried some butterbeer. After we looked around and ate some food we then went on multiple <Strong>Harry Potter</Strong> rides. One of them was even inside Hogwarts Castle. <Img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/103204698/630/472/image.jpg" alt="Hogwarts Castle" width="400" height="300"> </li>

<li> The next place we stopped was <Strong>Krustyland</Strong>. <Img src="https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-universal-hollywood-universal-studios-reopening-california-the-simpsons-ride-14-scaled.jpg" alt="Krustyland" width="400" height="300"> Here there were many fun games, rides, and even shows. We ate some more food at Moes and then went on the <Strong>Jaws</Strong> ride which was fun later in the day. We saw it was going to get dark so we went on the studio tour before that closed to the night. Then we finished up our night with the <Strong>Universal city walk</Strong> which was so fun to look at in the night time and grabbed a giant donut for a nightime snack. </li>
