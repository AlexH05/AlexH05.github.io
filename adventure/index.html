<h2 style="font-family:courier;color:violet;">July 21, 2016(morning)</h2> <p> Today we went to universal in California. We first got up early and ate a big coninental breakfast at the hotel. Next we got dressed and ready for the drive down there. We drove our rental car and got there just in time for open. We got there early so we could spend the whole day there and get our money's worth.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;color: MediumSeaGreen;">July 21, 2016 (afternoon)</h2> <p>  Once we got into the Park we had to take a picture of the universal globe. IMAGE Our next stop was in the Jurassic Park section. We first had to get a picture with Blue before we could go on any rides. The the Jurassic park ride came and we got soaked. IMAGE Then we headed over to diagon alley where there were a bunch of shops and resturants for us to look at. This is where we got an interactive wand and tried some butterbeer. After we looked around and ate some food we then went on multiple Harry Potter rides. One of them was even inside Hogwarts Castle. IMAGE </p>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;color:Tomato;">July 21, 2016 (evening)</h2> <p> The next place we stopped was Krustyland. IMAGE Here there were many fun games, rides, and even shows. We ate some more food at Moes and then went on the Jaws ride which was fun later in the day. We saw it was going to get dark so we went on the studio tour before that closed to the night. Then we finished up our night with the Universal city walk which was so fun to look at in the night time. </p>
